# CONTRIBUTING #

## Thanks ##
First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! I take this to mean that you have a vested interest in the project, its success, and inherent value!

## Process ##
For the moment, I really don't know how I intend to go about this! If you truly want to add some information or insight, please do so and send me a pull request. I will then evaluate and consider the contribution to be merged into the main project.

## GIT Setup ##
For now, I intend to use the Git Flow model as described by [Vincent Driessen's post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), which seems to have nearly become the *de facto* branching and development model.

Once I get a better handle on things, the layout and scope of this project, I may revise this document to reflect any necessary changes.
